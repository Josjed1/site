The login page is really simple however I just wanted to go for a really simple page that had some design on it, not too much

This is definitely my worst page I think, the least amount of time went it to it in terms of its looks sense I was working with the actual mysql code and getting it connected to the server

This page is for links to pages I generally spend a lot of my time on, and also just nods to things I enjoy such as the daily bugel for spiderman, but the main purpose of this page was to mest with lists and setting up links to other websites/pages.

This section is pretty self explanatory, I wasn't trying to go for anything crazy on here and wasn't originally going to be in this essay however I figured it was a little important just to give some basic of myself

This was my favorite page to code, it turned out a bit worst than I had hoped as this is something I was experimenting with and didn't know a lot of ways I could adjust the style of it, however I still enjoy that I'm able to upload videos to a website, and know how it is done.

This was the hardest page because I was working with mysql a lot in this and for some reason it brought a lot of issues with displaying the information, and also storing it into my database however I ended finding workarounds, the only issue I have which I dind't think to do was having drop down menus for the input instead of having a text box so that way there wasn't any mistyping, and also a delete button.
